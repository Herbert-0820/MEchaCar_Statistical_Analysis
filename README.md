# Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
There are many factors that consumers take into consideration when evaluating a car to purchase. However, in a world where ridesharing is becoming more ubiquitous and it's easy and cheap to get around in other people's vehicles, customers looking to purchase a car are looking for more than just a conveyance. They will be looking to buy a car that is an economical means to regularly transport themselves and their items on a reliable, regular basis.

# Metric to test
To narrow down our test, we should evaluate MechaCar's carrying capacity, in cubic inches, in comparison to various competitors' vehicles.

# Null and Alternate Hypothesis
H0: MechaCar prototypes' average carrying capacity is similar to competitor's vehicles in the same vehicle class Ha: MechaCar prototypes' average carrying capacity is statistically above or below that of competitor vehicles.

# Statistical Test Used
The best statistical test for this would be two-sample t-tests.

# What data is needed
We would need to gather cubic space data from the carrying compartments of all MechaCar prototypes, as well as from all major competitor vehicles.
